        content="A non-surgical, completely safe, and organic procedure that aids
              in hair retention and prevention of hair loss and has no side
              effects. At MAX Hair Clinic, we use a Closed-Casket Kit to collect
              plasma from the clientâ€™s blood using the modern German technology
              known as Closed Casket Platelet Rich Plasma (CC-PRP). This
              contains Growth factors, proteins, amino acids, nutrients, and
              electrolytes derived from the platelets. As a result, this Non-
              surgical treatment benefits by nurturing, rejuvenating, and
              promoting hair regrowth. Any damage to the scalp or hair follicles
              will return to their natural, healthy state. The closed-casket PRP
              machine has a single entry point and a single exit point; As a
              result, the plasma is pathogen- and toxin free and has not been
              exposed to the outside environment. The CC-PRP kit spins at 4000
              RPM, thus extracting growth factor concentrate (GFC) while
              protecting the cells through a self-cooling mechanism. MAX Hair
              Clinic ensures proper maintenance of hygiene. We use sterile and
              disposable CC-PRP kits. Catalyzing optimum healing. CC-PRP
              treatments are a 100% customizable procedure that increases hair
              density & quality and also counteracts baldness. Helps in the
              natural regenerative process of hair growth."
